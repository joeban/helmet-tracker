## Architecture Overview

This is a full-stack Node.js application that tracks Virginia Tech helmet safety ratings with real-time pricing from multiple retailers.

### Backend Structure (`src/`)
- **`server.js`** - Express server with REST API endpoints for helmets, categories, and pricing
- **`database/`** - SQLite database connection and schema management
- **`scrapers/`** - Web scraping system for retailer price collection
  - `scraper-manager.js` - Orchestrates all scrapers
  - Individual scrapers for Amazon, REI, Competitive Cyclist, Backcountry, Jenson USA
  - Runs automatically every 6 hours via cron jobs
- **`affiliates/`** - Affiliate link management for revenue generation
- **`data/`** - Sample data and Virginia Tech helmet safety data

### Frontend Structure (`client/src/`)
- **React SPA** - Single page application built with Create React App
- **API Integration** - Axios-based communication with backend REST API
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices

### Database Schema (SQLite)
- `helmets` - Virginia Tech safety data (star ratings, safety scores, technical metrics)
- `retailers` - Store information and affiliate configurations
- `helmet_listings` - Current prices and availability from scrapers
- `price_history` - Historical pricing data for trend analysis
- `scrape_logs` - Monitoring and debugging scraper performance

### Key Features
- **Safety-first filtering** - Sort by Virginia Tech 1-5 star ratings
- **Real-time pricing** - Automated price tracking across retailers
- **Affiliate monetization** - Built-in affiliate link management
- **Price history tracking** - Historical data for price trend analysis

## Virginia Tech STAR Rating System - Source of Truth

This application implements the Virginia Tech STAR (Summation of Tests for the Analysis of Risk) evaluation system as the authoritative source for helmet safety ratings.

### STAR Rating Methodology
- **Research Foundation**: Based on "Development of the STAR Evaluation System for Assessing Bicycle Helmet Protective Performance" (Bland et al., 2020)
- **Testing Protocol**: Custom oblique drop tower with 45¬∞ steel anvil generating equal normal and tangential incident velocities
- **Impact Locations**: 6 locations around helmet including commonly impacted rim areas not covered by standards
- **Velocities**: Two impact velocities (4.8 m/s and 7.3 m/s) based on real-world helmet damage replication studies
- **Kinematics Measurement**: Both linear acceleration (PLA) and peak rotational velocity (PRV) using biofidelic headform
- **Concussion Risk Function**: Combines PLA and PRV into injury risk estimates weighted by real-world impact frequency

### Current STAR Rating Thresholds (Updated July 2025)
**Bicycle Helmets**:
- 5 stars: < 10.1 STAR score (41 helmets, avg: 9.0)
- 4 stars: < 13.0 STAR score (98 helmets, avg: 11.6)
- 3 stars: < 16.0 STAR score (68 helmets, avg: 14.2)
- 2 stars: < 19.0 STAR score (35 helmets, avg: 17.5)
- 1 star: < 21.9 STAR score (20 helmets, avg: 19.8)
- 0 stars: >= 21.9 STAR score (19 helmets, avg: 23.6)

**Database Status**: Complete Virginia Tech database with 281 verified helmets

### Key STAR Findings
- **MIPS Technology**: Helmets with Multi-directional Impact Protection System show ~11-14% reduction in rotational velocity
- **Helmet Style**: Road helmets generally outperform urban helmets (average STAR 17.0 vs 21.4)
- **Price Correlation**: Slight negative correlation between price and STAR score (higher price = better protection)
- **Performance Range**: STAR values range from 10.9 (best) to 25.3 (worst) in original 30-helmet study

## Configuration

- **Environment setup** - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure affiliate IDs
- **Database** - SQLite database auto-created at `data/helmets.db` on first run
- **Scrapers** - Configure affiliate IDs in environment variables for revenue tracking
- **Production deployment** - Set `NODE_ENV=production` and build frontend first

## Data Management

### Virginia Tech Data Integration
Helmet safety data must align with Virginia Tech STAR methodology and current rating thresholds. Reference documents:
- `/Users/josephban/Downloads/s10439-019-02330-0.pdf` - Original STAR research paper
- `/Users/josephban/Downloads/Virginia Tech Helmet Ratings Memorandum - July 2025.pdf` - Current rating thresholds

### Required Helmet Data Fields
Based on STAR methodology, helmet entries require:
- `star_rating` - Current Virginia Tech rating (0-5 stars)
- `safety_score` - STAR score value (lower = better protection)
- `linear_acceleration` - Peak linear acceleration (g)
- `rotational_velocity` - Peak rotational velocity (rad/s)
- `concussion_risk_estimate` - Calculated injury risk percentage
- `category` - Road vs Urban classification
- `mips` - Boolean for MIPS technology presence

Helmet data requires manual entry via SQL INSERT statements into the `helmets` table following Virginia Tech testing protocols and current rating thresholds.

### Vercel Deployment Lessons Learned (September 2025)

### What We Tried and What Failed

**‚ùå Complex Serverless Approach (FAILED)**
- Initially tried deploying the full Node.js/React stack to Vercel
- Issues: "No entrypoint found which imports express", "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'fsPath')"
- Vercel couldn't properly detect the application type due to complex structure
- React builds, Node.js servers, and database connections created deployment chaos

**‚ùå Why Serverless Functions Failed Here**
- Tried to use `/api/helmets.js` as Vercel serverless function
- Functions work but created unnecessary complexity for static data
- Static helmet data doesn't need server-side processing
- Over-engineered solution for simple data display

### ‚úÖ What Actually Works: Keep It Simple

**‚úÖ Pure Static Site Approach**
```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Static HTML page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # CSS styling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js           # Client-side JavaScript with embedded data
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (no package.json)   # No Node.js confusion
```

**‚úÖ Key Success Factors:**
1. **No package.json** - Prevents Vercel from thinking it's a Node.js app
2. **Client-side data** - Embed Virginia Tech helmet data directly in JavaScript
3. **No build step** - Pure HTML/CSS/JS deploys instantly
4. **No API needed** - Static data doesn't require server endpoints

**‚úÖ Working Pattern:**
```javascript
// In script.js - embed data directly
const HELMET_DATA = [
    { id: 1, name: "Specialized Tactic 4", star_rating: 5, safety_score: 8.55, ... },
    // ... more helmets
];
```

### Why Serverless Was Wrong Here

**Question: "Why are we trying to go serverless?"**

**Answer: We shouldn't be.** Serverless functions are for:
- Dynamic data processing
- Database queries
- User authentication
- Real-time calculations

**Our helmet data is:**
- ‚úÖ Static Virginia Tech ratings (change rarely)
- ‚úÖ Known finite dataset (281 helmets)
- ‚úÖ Perfect for static embedding

### Deployment Recommendations

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Embed helmet data directly in JavaScript
- Use pure HTML/CSS/JS structure
- Deploy as static site (no package.json)
- Keep it simple

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Use serverless functions for static data
- Add unnecessary build steps
- Over-complicate with React for simple data display
- Use databases for read-only data that never changes

### MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Modern Tech Stack Implementation (September 2025)

- **‚úÖ Zero missing entries** - comprehensive parsing captured every helmet
- **‚úÖ Authentic data** - official names, scores, pricing, and star ratings

### üìä **Data Transformation Results:**

**Before (Outdated):**
- Mixed/unreliable helmet data
- Wrong #1 helmet (Specialized Tactic 4: 8.55)
- Missing top-performing RLS technology helmets
- Questionable data source and accuracy

**After (Official VT Data):**
1. **Canyon Deflectr RLS** - 6.82 STAR (Revolutionary RLS tech, $160)
2. **HEXR Miden RLS** - 6.93 STAR (RLS technology, $150)
3. **POC Cularis** - 7.10 STAR ($240)
4. **Fox Racing Speedframe RS** - 7.23 STAR ($279)
5. **POC Cytal** - 7.51 STAR ($330)

**Worst Performer:** Base Camp Urban Commuter - 26.57 STAR ($26)
